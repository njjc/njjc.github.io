Hello friend, my name is Nic. I was a software engineer with a great career writing open source software that helps tens of thousands of nonprofits. My career was the culmination of a decades of learning and effort, and I was well paid and well respected.

The only problem was that I was miserable. I burned out, my mental and physical health in shambles from stress, a toxic corporate environment, and a gnawing sense of meaninglessness. I had achieved my life goals and was worse off for it.

I have been a Buddhist meditation practitioner in daily life for over a decade and attended months of cumulative silent retreats, yet the fruits of that practice only really began landing in my being when I began incorporating the parts work using [Internal Family Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model) in combination with [Buddhist heart practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmavihara).

The symbiosis of parts work and Buddhist heart practice has impacted me profoundly, leading to rapid transformation of my life inside and out. From anxiety to ease. From depression to love. I then discovered [Aletheia](https://integralunfoldment.com/), a fourth generation coaching methodology that seamlessly integrates ancient wisdom and modern knowledge, providing the most rapid and enduring transformation I've experienced.

I found my calling in helping others integrate their unmetabolized experiences, to remember themselves experientally as fundamentally whole and deeply interconnected with the all. I'm now an Aletheia coach, authorized to teach Buddhist heart practices by [Stephen Snyder](https://awakeningdharma.org) in the lineage of [Pa Awk Sayadow](https://www.paaukforestmonastery.org/about-us). I'm also a member of the Association for Spiritual Integrity and abide by their [Honor Code of Ethics and Good Practice](https://www.spiritual-integrity.org/honor-code/honor-code-for-individuals/).

If you're interested in meditation practice and want an empathetic, attuned, and knowledgable guide to help you navigate life's unfolding, please reach out. I'd love to get to know you.
