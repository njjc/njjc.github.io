I'm Nic. I'm a programmer by vocation and a meditator by passion. As a Buddhist practitioner in daily life and regular retreats since 2010, the fruits of the thousands of hours of meditation and months of silent retreat practice have only really been landing in my being since 2020, when I began incorporating the [Internal Family Systems Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model) into my practice. 

The symbiosis of IFS and Buddhist practice, which I'm calling Internal Family Sangha, has had a profound impact in me, leading to rapid transformation of my life inside and out. From anxiety to ease. From depression to love.

Unifying Harmony is my attempt to share what I've learned with the world, exploring practices that I know from experience hold the potential to transform self and world.
