title: "Aletheia Coach"

Hello friend, my name is Nic Campbell. I was a software engineer with a great career writing open source software that helped tens of thousands of nonprofits. My career was the culmination of a decades of learning and effort, and I was well paid and well respected.

The only problem is that I was miserable. I burned out, my mental and physical health in shambles from stress, a toxic corporate environment, and a gnawing sense of meaninglessness. I had acheived my life goals and was worse off for it.

I have been a Buddhist practitioner in daily life and attended months of cumulative silent retreats since 2010, yet the fruits of that practice only really began landing in my being since 2020, when I began incorporating the parts work using [Internal Family Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model) in my practice.

The symbiosis of parts work and Buddhist meditation practice has impacted me profoundly, leading to rapid transformation of my life inside and out. From anxiety to ease. From depression to love. I then discovered [Aletheia](https://integralunfoldment.com/), a fourth generation coaching methodology that seamlessly integrates ancient wisdom with modern knowledge.

I found my calling in helping others know themselves experientally as fundamentally whole. I'm now an Aletheia coach, authorized to teach Buddhist heart practices by [Stephen Snyder](https://awakeningdharma.org) in the lineage of [Pa Awk Sayadow](https://www.paaukforestmonastery.org/about-us). If you're interested in meditation practice and want an empathetic, attuned, and knowledgable guide to help you navigate life's unfolding, please reach out. I'd love to get to know you.
